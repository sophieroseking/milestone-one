The Monkees band website - Milestone project 1

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

This is a four page website providing the band with a way to share their music and information about the band with their fans.

UX

User Stories

As a user I want to find some of the bandâ€™s videos and music so I can listen to and watch them.

As a user that enjoys band x, I would like to find a way to contact the band so I can book them for my 50th birthday party.

As a user, I like to follow my favourite bands on Instagram and Facebook so I can see what they are up to.

As a user, I would like to see if there are any upcoming tour dates so I can book to go and see them.

Client stories

As the band, we would like people to be able to see some of our music and videos so they reminisce about our old popular songs.

As the band, we would like to improve our social media following as we are looking to connect more with our fans.

As the band, we would like people to know a bit more about us so we can educate our fans, old and new.

As the band, we would like people to know that we are able to be booked for parties and events so we can start taking bookings.


I made an original mockup of the design using Balsamiq. This gave me a good idea of where I wanted to position certain things, although I changed this a lot during the process of creating the website.

Features

Existing Features
Social Media links - allows users who want to follow the band on social media to be able to quickly find the band's relevant social media pages, by clicking on them.
Media page - allows users who are or aren't familiar with the band to listen to their music and watch one of their music videos. This allows users to decide if they like the sound of the band if they haven't heard them before, or gives existing fans a way to listen to some of their best hits.
Contact form - 
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
