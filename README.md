The Monkees band website - Milestone project 1


This is a four page website providing the band 'The Monkees' with a way to share their music and information about the band with their fans.
This is a simple design, which uses the mobile-first approach. The colors used were picked from the background image of the band and was designed
to easily guide users to the information the band wanted them to know. The band were keen to gain new followers on socail emdia, so a large, fixed social 
media footer was used on each page. 


UX

User Stories

As a user I want to find some of the bandâ€™s videos and music so I can listen to and watch them.

As a user that enjoys band x, I would like to find a way to contact the band so I can book them for my 50th birthday party.

As a user, I like to follow my favourite bands on Instagram and Facebook so I can see what they are up to.

As a user, I would like to see if there are any upcoming tour dates so I can book to go and see them.


Client stories

As the band, we would like people to be able to see some of our music and videos so they reminisce about our old popular songs.

As the band, we would like to improve our social media following as we are looking to connect more with our fans.

As the band, we would like people to know a bit more about us so we can educate our fans, old and new.

As the band, we would like people to know that we are able to be booked for parties and events so we can start taking bookings.


I made an original mockup of the design using Balsamiq. This gave me a good idea of where I wanted to position certain things, although I changed this a lot during the process of creating the website.

Features

Existing Features
Social Media links - allows users who want to follow the band on social media to be able to quickly find the band's relevant social media pages, by clicking on them. I used wfont awesome for the socail media bottons.
Media page - allows users who are or aren't familiar with the band to listen to their music and watch one of their music videos. This allows users to decide if they like the sound of the band if they haven't heard them before, or gives existing fans a way to listen to some of their best hits.
Contact form - allows users to contact the band by filling in the form. I did this using the Bootstrap forms component.


Features Left to Implement
An idea I would like to include is a page or even a section of the homepage that allows users to see upcoming gig dates.


Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

Bootstrap v3.7
I used Bootstrap components for my nav bar and also made use of the column formatting to create my page using a mobile-first approach.

Font awesome
I used Font awesome for my social media icons

Google fonts
I wanted a 60's looking font to match the band's image, so used google fonts to acheive this.


Testing
I have tested the page using google developer tools, ensuring users get the best possible experience on all screen sizes.

Navbar:
Click on each navbar item to ensure it takes you to the right page.

Media items:
I tested to make sure the links were properly embedded to the page and they played correctly.

Contact form:
I tried to submit empty fields where they are required and verified that you get an erorr message.
I filled in the form and submitted it to check it works

I would like to add a feature that displays a message when the form has been submitted.


Deployment

The website has been deployed via GitHub pages.
